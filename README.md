# Covid-Dashboard-using-Tableau
Developed a dashboard using the Covid-19 world infection and vaccination data by querying the data using SQL, Microsoft SQL Server Management System, and later visualizing it using Tableau Public. Used Microsoft SSMS for implementing SQL queries and identifying several patterns in the Excel data. Was able to obtain the location-specific Time Series Line Plots, Geographic visualization, and several Bar graphs of the infection and vaccination data.
